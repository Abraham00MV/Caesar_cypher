# Caesar_cypher

>In this code, i attempt to create a cipher system based on Julius Caesar cipher method.
>That method takes a fixed number to shift in the alphabet and changes each letter to a new one
>This is a basic encryption  system than can be used to make a message confidential.
>For example if i have a string like "hello" with a fixed shift factor of  5
>we can replace each letter with a new letter shifted in the alphabet by 5 positions:
- "h-->n ,e-->k, l-->q, l-->q, o--> t"
- plain message : "hello"
- encrypted message : "nkqqot"
